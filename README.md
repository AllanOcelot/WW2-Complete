# WW2-Complete
An interactive visual history of WW2. Showing a complete timeline, on a day by day basis.


# What is this?
WW2 Complete is a side project I am creating in my spare time. I want to create an unbiased history of World War 2, presented in the form of a world map, listing and showing events. The data we show on the website will be user submitted and peer reviewed. All content will have the option to be revewied by specalists at a later date.


# Why?
I have always had a keen interest in this specific period of histroy. It's my hope that I can present a project that people of all generations can use and learn from. I don't aim to glorify the war or show a biased view. All information will be factual and non-biased. 


# Plan
- [ ] Build Basic Map
- [ ] Build 'Add Event' Tool
- [ ] Build 'Timeline' Tool
- [ ] Display Events on Map at specific date
- [ ] When clicked events should show more information, with links to sources
- [ ] Add in Ability for users to review, add and edit data (After approval from Mod)
